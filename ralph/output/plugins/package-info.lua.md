# Plugin: package-info.lua

**Plugin:** vuki656/package-info.nvim

## Custom Keybindings

*No keybindings defined in this configuration file.*

## Notes

This plugin configuration only sets options without defining any custom keymaps. The plugin provides commands for package.json management but relies on default plugin commands rather than custom key bindings.

The plugin auto-activates when opening `package.json` files and provides:
- Virtual text showing package version status
- Package manager integration (yarn/npm)

See `plugin_defaults:package-info.nvim` for the plugin's default keybindings and commands.
